# Mechanism-of-Particle-Deposition
Hello there!  Here is a project portfolio for my Senior Capstone Project (2021-2022)
This is a project provided by **Integrity Industrial Inkjet Integration** who needed a printing manufacturing process that can print on a wide range of surfaces. 

- **Background**

The client currently has a method of layering adhesive and various powders on an inkjet conveyor that does not meet their standards.

- **Problem**

Provide proof of principle, using glitter as a substitute for various powders. The module is to be attached to a conveyor belt along with an Inkjet printer head that will dispense a uniform coating of glitter on an adhesive with a method to recover and reuse any additional glitter that is not used.

- **Benefits**

A fully functional module will prevent material waste and reduce cost while producing high quality/ high resolution prints for clients across several industries.


 **Client Requirements**

- Maintain clean workspace and ensure  minimal glitter escapes the box 
- Maximize glitter use to create less waste and reduce cost on materials
- A way to easily control device to stop or divert the glitter flow
- Must only remove excess glitter and not glitter that has been adhered
- Be able to do multiple colors of glitters and multiple layers of glute/glitters
- Must not exceed surface area of conveyer belt plate: 7.5'' x 7.5''
